## Purpose

Create a communication program in the form of a client and a server.

• The server must be started first. After its launch, it has to print its PID.<br />
• The client takes two parameters:<br />

◦ The server PID.<br />
◦ The string to send.

• The client must send the string passed as a parameter to the server and once the string has been received, the server must print it.<br />
• The server has to display the string pretty quickly.

## Important functions to learn

To complete this project it is important to learn and understand how some functions work, such as :<br />
◦ signal<br />
◦ sigaction<br />
◦ kill<br />
◦ getpid<br />
◦ pause<br />
◦ sleep<br />
◦ usleep<br />
◦ exit<br />

Not forgetting also the importance of knowing how to manipulate bits with bitwise operators:<br />

For example we have A with the value of 60 and B with the value of 13.<br />
Converting these values to a base of 2 we get the results of A = 00111100 and B = 00001101.

Now let's check how these operators work:
